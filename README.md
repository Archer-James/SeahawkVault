# The Seahawk Vault – Honors Thesis

## Overview

**The Seahawk Vault** is a full-stack web application designed and developed for my Honors Thesis at the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW). The project blends technical innovation with digital memory preservation, offering students a secure, dynamic platform to upload and access college memories—photos, messages, and more—organized by graduation year and privacy preferences.

This work culminates in a comprehensive thesis paper detailing the research, design, development, and reflection behind the app. The project was inspired by the concept of time capsules and the evolving role of digital diaries in contemporary culture.
